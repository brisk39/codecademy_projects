# codecademy_projects - hurricanes
The project is about hurricanes.  
The goal is to organize and manipulate data about Category 5 Hurricanes, the strongest hurricanes as rated by their wind speed. 
Each one of these functions will use a number of parameters, conditionals, lists, dictionaries, string manipulation, and return statements.

There are 4 major steps dealing with data.
Step 1: clean the data
Damages are written in different format and thus need to be written in float to make them comparable. 
Step 2: learn the data
building a dictionary to have a gist of the data, and the name of hurricane is set as the key.
Values are set in list, and the numerical values include months, years, max_sustained_winds, and deaths. 
And values including names, and areas_affected are in string format, and the value of damages is in mixed format.
Step 3: find insights - maximum
Building functions to explore the extremes including greatest damages, the largest number of deaths.
Step 4: build rating system -scales
Building rating systems based on damages, mortality rate 

By completing the data, I have a deeper understanding of the processes to complete a real project and why should I have these processes.
Asking the reason why and clarying the question are more important than merely sloving the problem. The back and forth of reasoning mirrors the communication with 
colleagues and clients in real life. If they are not with me to solve the problem, there is no point in solving that so-called problem.
In order to apply what I learned into practice, a solid grasp of function, control flow, list, string, and dictionary is of high significance.

Wish you good luck on this project.
